This project explores the differences in asset returns between trading hours and non-trading hours in financial markets



Return Differences Between Trading and Non-Trading Hours: Like Night and Day
Overview
This project explores the differences in returns during trading and non-trading hours in financial markets. By analyzing these two timeframes, we identify patterns, disparities, and the factors driving variations in returns, highlighting how markets behave "like night and day".

Objective
Investigate the differences in asset returns between trading hours and non-trading hours.
Determine the underlying causes and patterns for these return differences.
Provide insights into market efficiency, investor behavior, and price movements.
Scope of the Project
Trading Hours: The period when markets are actively open for trading.
Non-Trading Hours: The time outside regular market sessions (overnight, weekends, or holidays).
Data Sources:
Historical price and return data of financial instruments (e.g., stocks, ETFs, indices).
Time-series data for trading vs. non-trading sessions.
Key Features
Return Calculation:
Calculate returns for both trading hours (open-to-close) and non-trading hours (close-to-open).
Statistical Analysis:
Compare average returns, volatility, and risk-adjusted returns.
Visualization:
Graphs and charts to display patterns in return differences.
Insights:
Identify factors like overnight news, macroeconomic events, or liquidity changes driving differences.
